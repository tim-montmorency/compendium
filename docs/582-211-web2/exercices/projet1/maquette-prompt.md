Create a responsive one-page website wireframe in Figma using proper Auto Layout on all sections and components.

Target viewport: Desktop 1440px width. But has to be flexible enough to be adapted to smaller screens (mobile/tablet versions not required for this project).

Do NOT include mobile/tablet versions - desktop only but flexible layout.

The structure must be clean and logically organized for HTML + CSS integration (Flexbox-based layout).

Do NOT use CSS Grid concepts. The layout should be realistically achievable with Flexbox only.

LANGUAGE:
All text content must be in French (generic placeholder content).

THEME FOR THIS WIREFRAME:
Local climbing gym (gym d’escalade local)
Use contextually appropriate placeholder text and icon suggestions

GLOBAL STRUCTURE:
- Desktop width frame (1440px)
- Logical vertical stacking of sections
- Each section in its own frame with Auto Layout
- Use consistent container width (max-width style behavior)
- Add realistic spacing (but not perfectly consistent)
- Include placeholder images (if possible use from https://static.photos/ or similar free source)

SECTIONS TO INCLUDE:

1) STICKY NAVIGATION
- Logo (left)
- 5 menu items (right)
- CTA button
- Slight spacing inconsistency in menu alignment

2) HERO SECTION
- Full-width background image placeholder
- Centered headline
- Subheadline
- Primary CTA button
- Optional secondary CTA link
- Slightly oversized text block (too wide for optimal readability)

3) À PROPOS
- Two-column layout (60/40 split)
- Left: Text content (2-3 paragraphs)
- Right: Image placeholder
- Include a highlighted quote block
- Slight imbalance in column spacing

4) SERVICES / OFFRES
- 3 cards in horizontal layout
- Each card: Icon placeholder, title, short text, button
- Cards should NOT have identical heights
- Spacing between cards slightly inconsistent

5) SECTION LISTE OU HORAIRE
- 5x3 structured content (like a schedule or feature matrix)
- Layout achievable with nested flex containers
- Some cells slightly wider than others

6) ÉQUIPE
- 4 profile cards
- Circular image placeholder
- Name + small description
- Slight inconsistency in vertical spacing between cards

7) TARIFICATION
- 3 pricing tiers side-by-side
- Middle tier visually emphasized
- Feature list in each card
- Alignment not perfectly symmetrical

8) TÉMOIGNAGES
- 2-3 testimonial blocks
- Asymmetrical layout
- Different card widths

9) CONTACT
- Two-column layout
- Left: Form (Nom, Email, Message)
- Right: Contact info block
- Slight vertical misalignment between columns

10) FOOTER
- Three columns
- Quick links
- Small about text
- Social icons placeholders
- Columns not perfectly balanced

DESIGN STYLE:
- Neutral modern wireframe (no strong branding)
- Use neutral grayscale colors
- Rounded corners on cards
- Subtle shadow on key elements


OPTIONAL VISUAL TOUCHES (if possible):
- Use one accent color for CTAs and highlights
- Otherwise keep neutral grays
- Rounded corners (8px) on cards and buttons

IMPORTANT – PEDAGOGICAL IMPERFECTIONS:
- Mixed spacing values (not from strict 8px system)
- Some text blocks too wide
- Slight alignment inconsistencies
- Inconsistent padding inside certain cards
- Minor hierarchy imbalance (H2 vs H3 sizes)
- CTA button alignment slightly off

Ensure all sections use Auto Layout properly and are structured so that students can extract meaningful CSS from Dev Mode.

The layout should look realistic but intentionally imperfect for learning purposes.
