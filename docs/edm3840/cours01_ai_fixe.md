## Structure des prompts

- [ ] **Utiliser des termes précis** pour décrire la composition et les éléments visuels (par exemple, "une rue pavée sous la pluie" plutôt que "une rue").
- [ ] **Mentionner l'angle de vue** pour orienter la caméra (par exemple, "plan rapproché", "plongée", "contre-plongée", "vue aérienne").
- [ ] **Définir l'ambiance et le style** de l'image en fonction du ressenti souhaité (par exemple, "atmosphère lumineuse", "sombre", "surréaliste", "cinématographique", "un photographe connu", "un mouvement artistique", "un style").
- [ ] **Décrire en détail les personnages ou objets principaux**, leur position, expression, taille, vêtements et textures (par exemple, "un homme en costume, avec une expression déterminée, tenant un livre").
- [ ] **Spécifier les couleurs ou palettes chromatiques** importantes pour la composition (par exemple, "teintes saturées", "nuances pastel", "contraste élevé").
- [ ] **Indiquer l'éclairage**, qu'il soit naturel ou artificiel, et s'il est doux, fort, directionnel ou diffus (par exemple, "éclairage doux venant de la gauche, lumière naturelle").
- [ ] **Ajouter des détails sur l'arrière-plan et le décor** (par exemple, "arrière-plan urbain", "forêt luxuriante", "intérieur minimaliste").
- [ ] **Inclure des modificateurs de style** qui influencent l'esthétique générale (par exemple, "réaliste", "abstrait", "rétro", "futuriste").
- [ ] **Préciser la profondeur de champ**, en indiquant si l'arrière-plan doit être flou ou bien net (par exemple, "flou artistique en arrière-plan, mise au point sur l'objet principal").
- [ ] **Vérifier la cohérence générale du prompt**, en s'assurant que tous les éléments se complètent bien pour créer une image harmonieuse.

## Gestion des images de référence

- **Ajouter une image de référence** dans le prompt pour aider l'IA à mieux comprendre l'atmosphère ou les éléments visuels souhaités.
- **Modifier l'image de référence** en fonction des détails supplémentaires que vous incluez dans votre prompt, comme l'éclairage, les couleurs ou l'ambiance générale que vous souhaitez obtenir.
- **Utiliser une image générée précédemment** comme nouvelle référence. Cela permet de créer une série d'images cohérentes en réutilisant une génération précédente comme point de départ.
- **Être précis dans le prompt** si vous ne voulez pas que l'image de référence soit trop modifiée pour que l'IA reste fidèle à l'image originale.

### Exemples d'utilisation d'une image de référence :

- *"Inspiré de cette image (fichier d'image), ajouter un éclairage dramatique avec des ombres profondes et une atmosphère sombre. Atténuer les couleurs avec des teintes bleues dominantes."*
- *"Utiliser cette image de référence (fichier d'image), mais changer le personnage principal pour un homme plus jeune et remplacer le fond par une forêt brumeuse."*

## Créativité vs Pertinence

- **Pertinence :** Créer des visuels **fidèles** à la description donnée ou à l'image de référence.
- **Créativité :** Laisser l'IA **vous surprendre** avec des résultats inattendus en laissant plus de place à l'interprétation.

## Invites négatives

- Dans certains cas, **spécifier ce que vous ne voulez pas** dans l'image pour mieux contrôler le résultat final et éliminer des éléments indésirables.
